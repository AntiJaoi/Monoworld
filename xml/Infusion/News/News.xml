    <content>Important message: Breaking changes incoming

2.0.0 test build is out on GitHub!

2.0.0 will host lots and lots of changes, ranging from super-frequently-requested extracting and applying infusions, explosive infusions, and rebalanced everythings.

Even though the update is classified as a "breaking" one, there are automatic migrations to keep your save safe.
(But almost all of your existing infusions will be affected, being removed or changed.)

If you would like to opt out of incoming changes, use Mod Manager to backup this version (1.8.2), or download 1.8.1 from GitHub and install it manually.

To download the latest release including 2.0.0, visit https://git.io/JfmlW
